# Experiment methodology
For our experiment, we wanted to test the runtime of our algorithm as the n x n matrix increases in size. 
First, we created two methods, populateArray() and getAverage(). Method populate fills a matrix with consecutive integers 
increasing by 1, starting at 1. 

For example, in a 3 x 3 matrix, the elements would be <br />
| 1 2 3 | <br />
| 4 5 6 | <br />
| 7 8 9 | <br />

Our method getAverage() returned the average time, in nanoseconds, it takes for the search algorithm to find its value in a given matrix. Average runtime is computed by repeating each matrixSearch() operation 10,000 times and dividing by number of iterations.
